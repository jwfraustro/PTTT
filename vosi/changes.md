# Changes to the VOSI standard

Brief description of deviations from the current VOSI standard.

## VOSI Tables

- `TableSet` and `Table` elements from the VOSI XSD definition have not been implemented (and VODataService, by extension).
- `detail` parameter defined as lowercase

## VOSI Availability

- Availability response has been modeled as a schema object.

## VOSI Capabilities

- `Capabilities` elements from the VOSI XSD definition have not been implemented (and VODataService/VOResource, by extension).
